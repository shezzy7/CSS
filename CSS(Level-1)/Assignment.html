    <!-- Poem -->
    <p>
        I met a travellor from antique land,<br>
        who said-"Two vast and trunkless legs of stone <br>
        stand in the desert.... Near them, on the stand, <br>
        Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown, <br>
        And wrikled lip, and sneer of cold command,<br>
        Tell that its sculptor well those passions read <br>
        which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things, <br>
        The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;<br>
        And on the pedestal, those words appear: <br>
        My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings; <br>
        Look my works, ye mighty, and despire "
    </p>
